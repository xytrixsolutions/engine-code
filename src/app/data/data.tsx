          intro: `The BMW N47D20A is a 1,995 cc turbocharged diesel engine produced from 2007 to 2011.
This inline-4 powerplant features a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT), common rail direct injection,
and dual overhead camshafts. Outputs ranged from 120 kW (163 PS) in base variants to 135 kW (184 PS)
in high-tune applications, with peak torque spanning 350–380 Nm. Primary applications include the E87 1 Series,
E90 3 Series, and E60 5 Series, notably powering the 118d, 320d, and 520d models.
A critical reliability concern involves premature timing chain wear leading to catastrophic failure, documented in BMW SIB 11 02 17.
This issue stems from insufficient lubrication at the chain tensioner during cold starts.
Engineered for executive vehicles requiring a balance between performance and efficiency, the N47D20A achieved Euro 4 emissions certification
through exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and diesel particulate filtration. Post-2010 models received minor revisions before transitioning to the N47N variant
with reinforced timing components.`,

Aftermarket upgrades (larger turbo, intercooler, exhaust) can boost power further. Enthusiasts frequently remap 116d/118d and 320d models for crisper response. Of course, any tuning should be done carefully and with supporting mods to avoid over-stressing the engine.",

Smaller models (116d/118d) with the same engine often see better economy. Real-world figures will depend on driving style, but expect 45-55 mpg (UK) on mixed roads for a healthy N47D20A.",
