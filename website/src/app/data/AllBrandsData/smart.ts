It delivers 60 kW (82 PS) and 160 Nm of torque, driving the rear wheels through a single-speed reduction gearbox.
This motor enables urban-focused EV performance with zero tailpipe emissions and is integrated with Smart’s modular electric drive platform.`,

Emissions compliance is inherently met as a zero-emission vehicle under EU Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 Annex I, with type approval granted by the UK Vehicle Certification Agency.`,

            question: "Is the eDC 60 kW reliable long-term?",
            answer:
              "The eDC 60 kW is generally robust due to its simple architecture, but early models (2017–2019) had inverter cooling limitations under high heat. Post-2020 revisions improved thermal management. With proper coolant maintenance and gearbox oil changes, it can exceed 200,000 km reliably.",

          {
            question: "What are the most common problems with eDC 60 kW?",
            answer:
              "Key issues include inverter thermal derating (especially pre-2020), reduction gearbox whine from old oil, 12V battery drain due to software bugs, and charging port latch failures. All are documented in Smart service bulletins STB-EM-2019-04 and SIB EM-2020-02.",

          {
            question: "Which Smart models use the eDC 60 kW motor?",
            answer:
              "Exclusively the Smart EQ Fortwo (W453) and Forfour (HA453) from 2017 to 2022. Both are rebadged Renault Zoe-based EVs with rear-wheel drive. No other Smart or Mercedes models use this exact motor variant.",
          },
          {
            question: "Can the eDC 60 kW be tuned for more power?",
            answer:
              "No. The motor and inverter are locked to 60 kW by Smart/MBUX firmware. Unlike combustion engines, EV tuning requires inverter remapping and cooling upgrades, which void type approval and are unsupported by OEM documentation.",
          },
          {
            question: "What's the range and efficiency of the eDC 60 kW?",
            answer:
              "Official WLTP range is 159 km (99 miles). Real-world efficiency is ~14.5 kWh/100 km (city) and ~16.2 kWh/100 km (mixed). Expect 120–140 km in temperate climates, less in winter due to cabin heating load on the 17.6 kWh battery.",
          },
          {
            question: "Is the eDC 60 kW an interference motor?",
            answer:
              "Not applicable—electric motors have no valves or timing components. However, mechanical seizure from gearbox failure or bearing wear can still immobilize the drivetrain, though catastrophic internal damage is rare.",
          },
          {
            question: "What oil type does eDC 60 kW require?",
            answer:
              "The reduction gearbox requires Castrol Syntrax Long Life 75W-90 (or equivalent meeting MB 235.10 spec). Change every 80,000 km or 5 years. The motor and inverter use separate coolant (Glysantin G48), not oil.",

            `The Smart eDC 82 kW is a permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor co-developed with Renault for the Smart EQ Fortwo and Forfour (453 platform) from 2018 to 2024.
It delivers 82 kW (111 PS) and 160 Nm of torque through a single-speed reduction gearbox, enabling 0–100 km/h in approximately 11.4 seconds.
Liquid-cooled power electronics and a high-voltage traction battery (17.6 kWh usable) support consistent urban performance and thermal stability.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Smart EQ Fortwo and Forfour hatchbacks, the eDC 82 kW motor was engineered for agile city driving, silent operation, and low lifecycle emissions.
Regenerative braking with selectable modes enhances efficiency in stop-start traffic.
The powertrain complies with Euro 6d emissions-equivalent standards for zero-tailpipe vehicles under EU Regulation (EC) No 715/2007 and VCA Type Approval protocols.`,
            `One documented concern is intermittent loss of drive reported in early 2018–2019 builds, linked to software-induced inverter shutdowns under rapid thermal cycling.
This issue was addressed in Renault–Smart Service Bulletin SIB-EM-04-2019, which mandated an update to the motor control unit (MCU) firmware to improve thermal hysteresis logic and prevent false fault triggers.`,

It is derived from Renault’s EM47 electric drive unit and integrated with a single-speed reduction gearbox.
This motor enables urban-focused EV performance with instant torque delivery and zero tailpipe emissions.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Smart EQ Fortwo (W453) and Forfour (HA3) hatchbacks, the e-Motor 60 was engineered for compact city mobility with responsive low-speed acceleration and efficient energy use.
Emissions compliance is inherent to its zero-emission design, meeting EU CO₂ fleet targets under Regulation (EU) 2019/631 and qualifying for UK VCA Type Approval as a Category M1 battery-electric vehicle.`,
            `One documented concern is inverter capacitor degradation in early 2018–2019 builds, highlighted in Smart Service Information Bulletin SIB EL‑04 19.
This issue stems from thermal stress on DC-link capacitors during repeated high-load cycles, potentially triggering power-limiting faults.
From 2020, revised inverter hardware with improved thermal management was introduced across the Smart EQ lineup.`,

Renault Type DFE (75W‑90) gear oil must be replaced every 60,000 km or 4 years to protect the reduction gearbox. The 17.6 kWh battery pack uses passive thermal management; frequent DC fast charging in hot climates may accelerate cell degradation. Regenerative braking reduces pad wear but can cause uneven rotor deposits if used excessively without friction braking. Software updates via Smart Service Portal may resolve inverter fault codes related to capacitor ripple current.`,

            `The Smart EQ e-Motor 82 is a permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor with a rated output of 60 kW (82 PS) and peak torque of 160 Nm, produced from 2018 through 2024. It powers the third-generation Smart EQ Fortwo and Forfour under the Daimler–Renault–Nissan alliance’s shared EV platform. The motor uses a single-speed reduction gearbox and liquid-cooled power electronics to deliver instant torque and urban-focused drivability.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Smart EQ Fortwo (453) and Forfour (453) models, the e-Motor 82 was engineered for compact city mobility with zero tailpipe emissions. Compliance with Euro 6d-TEMP and later Euro 6d standards was achieved via full electric propulsion, eliminating the need for exhaust aftertreatment systems. The motor’s integration with Renault-sourced battery and inverter modules reflects platform-level collaboration between Smart and Renault.`,
            `One documented concern is inverter capacitor degradation under sustained high-load conditions, noted in Smart Service Information Bulletin EV‑04‑2021. This issue stems from thermal stress on DC-link capacitors in early-build power electronics units. From mid-2022, Smart introduced updated inverter firmware and revised capacitor materials to improve thermal resilience.`,

The reduction gearbox uses a sealed-for-life design, but Smart recommends checking for leaks at 80,000 km or 6 years. Early units (2018–2021) may exhibit inverter capacitor drift under repeated fast charging; updated firmware (v2.1+) mitigates this per Smart SIB EV-04-2021. Battery preconditioning during cold weather preserves drivetrain efficiency and extends component life.`,

It delivers 200 kW (272 PS) and 343 Nm of torque through a single-speed reduction gearbox, enabling 0–100 km/h in 6.7 seconds.
The motor architecture integrates oil-cooling and hairpin winding technology to enhance thermal efficiency and power density.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Smart #1 Pulse and Pro+ variants in European markets, the SGE 200 – Electric was engineered for responsive urban mobility and sustained motorway performance.
Emissions compliance is inherently zero-tailpipe, meeting EU Regulation (EU) 2019/631 CO₂ fleet targets and UK VCA Whole Vehicle Type Approval requirements for battery-electric vehicles.`,

Geely internal telemetry from 2023 showed a measurable subset of pre-Q3 2023 vehicles reporting torque interruption events, while UK DVSA data confirms no safety recalls but notes software-related drivability complaints. Frequent DC fast charging and cold-weather operation amplify thermal stress, making software currency and coolant integrity critical.`,

            `The Smart SGE 300 – Electric is a permanent-magnet synchronous electric motor developed by Geely for Smart’s all-electric platform, produced from 2022 to present.
It delivers 200 kW (272 PS) and 343 Nm of torque via a single-speed reduction gearbox, enabling 0–100 km/h in under 5.5 seconds.
Integrated power electronics and liquid-cooled stator windings support sustained performance and rapid DC charging capability.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Smart #1 and Smart #3 crossover SUVs, the SGE 300 – Electric was engineered for agile urban mobility with highway-capable refinement.
Regenerative braking with multi-level adjustability enhances efficiency, while the motor’s compact axial-flux design reduces unsprung mass.
Emissions compliance is inherent to its zero-tailpipe-emission architecture, meeting EU Regulation (EU) 2019/631 CO₂ fleet targets and UK VCA Whole Vehicle Type Approval standards.`,
            `One documented concern is inverter capacitor degradation under repeated high-load DC fast charging cycles, highlighted in Smart Service Information Bulletin EL‑2023‑09.
This is linked to thermal stress on DC-link capacitors in early-build power electronics modules.
From Q3 2023, Smart introduced a revised inverter assembly with enhanced thermal management and upgraded capacitor materials.`,

            question: "Can the SGE 300 – Electric be tuned for more power?",
            answer:
              "No. The motor and inverter are sealed units with locked calibration. Smart does not authorize power upgrades, and aftermarket tuning voids the high-voltage warranty. Performance is fixed at 200 kW (272 PS) by OEM design.",

            question: "What's the energy consumption of the SGE 300 – Electric?",
            answer:
              "In the Smart #1 Brabus, typical consumption is ~17.5 kWh/100km (city) and ~14.2 kWh/100km (highway), or about 4.2–5.1 mi/kWh. Real-world mixed driving yields 15–16 kWh/100km depending on climate and regen settings.",

          {
            question: "Is the SGE 300 – Electric an interference engine?",
            answer:
              "Not applicable—it is an electric motor with no pistons, valves, or timing components. Mechanical failure modes differ entirely from internal combustion engines.",

            question: "What fluid does the SGE 300 – Electric require?",
            answer:
              "Only the reduction gearbox requires fluid: Smart EV-GL4 75W-90, changed every 160,000 km or 8 years. The motor and inverter use a separate ethylene-glycol coolant circuit with no user-serviceable intervals.",
