            question: "What are the most common problems with E20?",
            answer:
              "Top issues include exhaust cam lobe wear (pre-2008), ignition coil failures in humid climates, plastic thermostat housing leaks, and occasional timing chain tensioner rattle. All are documented in SsangYong service bulletins and can be mitigated with proper maintenance.",
          },
          {
            question: "Which SsangYong models use the E20 engine?",
            answer:
              "The E20 was used in the Kyron (2005–2010) and Rexton II (2006–2010) as the 2.0-litre petrol option. No other manufacturers used this engine. It was never offered in the Actyon or Korando during this period.",
          },
          {
            question: "Can the E20 be tuned for more power?",
            answer:
              "Limited tuning potential. The naturally aspirated design and conservative ECU mapping allow only modest gains (~10–15 kW) via remap and intake/exhaust upgrades. Forced induction is not recommended due to stock compression ratio and lack of forged internals.",
          },
          {
            question: "What's the fuel economy of the E20?",
            answer:
              "In a Kyron 2.0 XVT, expect ~11.5 L/100km (city), ~8.2 L/100km (highway), or ~30 mpg UK combined. Real-world mixed driving typically yields 28–32 mpg UK, depending on load and terrain.",
          },
          {
            question: "Is the E20 an interference engine?",
            answer:
              "Yes. The E20 is an interference engine. If the timing chain fails or jumps, piston-to-valve contact will cause severe internal damage. Regular inspection of chain tension and oil quality is essential to prevent catastrophic failure.",
          },
          {
            question: "What oil type does E20 require?",
            answer:
              "SsangYong specifies SAE 10W-40 oil meeting ACEA A3/B3 or API SL/CF standards. Low-SAPS or 5W-30 oils are not approved. Oil must be changed every 10,000 km or 12 months to protect camshafts and timing components.",

It features dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), 16 valves, and sequential multi‑point fuel injection.
In standard form it delivered 104 kW (141 PS) and 197 Nm of torque, providing adequate performance for urban and highway use.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Korando (C200), Rexton W, and Rodius,
the G20 was engineered for reliability and cost‑effective ownership in compact and midsize SUVs.
Emissions compliance was achieved through a three‑way catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
allowing it to meet Euro 4 and later Euro 5 standards depending on model year.`,
            `One documented concern is premature wear of the exhaust camshaft lobes,
highlighted in SsangYong Technical Service Bulletin TSB‑ENG‑2013‑08.
This issue is attributed to insufficient surface hardening during early production batches.
From 2014 onward, revised camshafts with improved metallurgy were introduced across all G20 applications.`,

In standard form it delivered 129 kW (175 PS) at 6,000 rpm and 221 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm,
providing linear power delivery suitable for mid‑size SUV applications.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Rexton W (Y400) and Korando C (C200),
the G23D was engineered for dependable everyday performance with emphasis on smoothness and refinement.
Emissions compliance was achieved through a closed‑loop three‑way catalytic converter and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
allowing adherence to Euro 5 standards across all production years.`,

highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB‑ENG‑2017‑09.
This issue is attributed to marginal lubrication under sustained high‑load conditions.
From 2018 onward, revised camshaft metallurgy and updated oil specifications were introduced to mitigate the problem.`,

ACEA A3/B4 (or SsangYong Longlife 5W‑30) oil is critical due to its high shear stability and anti-wear additives protecting cam lobes. Extended idling or frequent short trips accelerate oil contamination; periodic oil analysis is advised for high‑mileage engines. Post‑2018 models feature hardened camshafts per SB‑ENG‑2017‑09.

            `The SsangYong G32D is a 3,198 cc, V6 petrol engine produced between 2018 and 2025.
It features dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), 24 valves, and variable valve timing (VVT) on both intake and exhaust camshafts.
In standard form it delivers 190 kW (258 PS) and 360 Nm of torque, engineered for smooth highway performance and towing capability.`,
            `Fitted primarily to the Rexton (Y400) and Korando Sports (later Tivoli-based SUVs in select markets),
the G32D was designed for drivers requiring refined V6 power with modern emissions compliance.
Emissions control is achieved via a close-coupled three-way catalytic converter and electronic engine management,
enabling Euro 6d compliance across all production years.`,
            `One documented concern is premature wear of the high-pressure fuel pump drive lobe on the exhaust camshaft,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB‑ENG‑2021‑03.
This issue stems from insufficient surface hardening during early production batches.
From mid‑2021, revised camshafts with improved metallurgy were introduced to address the defect.`,

ACEA C3 5W-30 oil is critical due to its low-SAPS formulation protecting the three-way catalyst. Extended idling or frequent short trips accelerate carbon buildup on intake valves. The high-pressure fuel pump drive lobe on early camshafts (pre-06/2021) is prone to wear; replacement with updated camshaft per SB‑ENG‑2021‑03 is recommended if noise or misfire occurs.`,

            `The SsangYong 2.0L T-GDi is a 1,998 cc, inline‑four turbocharged petrol engine produced from 2018 to present.
It features gasoline direct injection, dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), and a single twin-scroll turbocharger.
In standard form it delivers 174 kW (237 PS) and 350 Nm of torque, providing strong mid-range pull and responsive throttle behaviour.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Rexton (Y400), Korando (C300), and Musso (Q200),
the 2.0L T-GDi was engineered for a balance of performance, refinement, and towing capability.
Emissions compliance was achieved through a close-coupled three-way catalytic converter and cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
meeting Euro 6d TEMP standards from launch.`,
            `One documented concern is high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) wear under sustained high-load conditions,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB-ENG-2021-08.
This issue stems from marginal lubricity in certain fuel batches interacting with pump internals.
From 2022, SsangYong introduced an updated HPFP with revised metallurgy and sealing.`,

              "Yes. Stage 1 ECU remaps typically yield +20–30 kW and +50–70 Nm safely, as the turbo and internals have headroom. However, tuning increases HPFP and GPF stress—use only with high-quality fuel and extended warm-up cycles. No official SsangYong tuning support exists.",

            `The SsangYong 2.5L T-GDi is a 2,497 cc, inline‑four turbocharged direct-injection petrol engine introduced in 2019.
It features dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), 16 valves, and a twin-scroll turbocharger paired with high-pressure direct fuel injection.
In standard form it delivers 165 kW (225 PS) and 360 Nm of torque, with strong mid-range pull and refined high-rpm response.`,
            `Fitted to the Rexton and Korando SUVs, the 2.5L T-GDi was engineered for responsive performance and smooth towing capability,
offering a balance between power delivery and fuel efficiency in mid- to large-size applications.
Emissions compliance is achieved through a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
and precise lambda control, meeting Euro 6d standards across all production years.`,
            `One documented concern is premature high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) wear under sustained high-load conditions,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin ENG‑03‑2021.
This issue stems from marginal lubricity in certain regional fuel batches interacting with early-design pump internals.
From late 2022, revised HPFP units with hardened plungers and updated cam follower geometry were introduced.`,

              "The 2.5L T-GDi offers strong performance and refinement, but early models (2019–late 2022) had HPFP wear concerns. Post-2022 revisions improved fuel pump durability significantly. With strict adherence to oil changes (10,000 km) and use of 95 RON fuel, well-maintained examples can exceed 200,000 km reliably.",

            question: "What are the most common problems with 2.5L T-GDi?",
            answer:
              "Top issues include high-pressure fuel pump wear (pre-2023), turbo actuator sticking, GPF clogging from short trips, and occasional timing chain tensioner rattle. All are documented in SsangYong service bulletins and can be mitigated with proper maintenance and driving habits.",

            question: "Which SsangYong models use the 2.5L T-GDi engine?",
            answer:
              "The 2.5L T-GDi was used in the Rexton (2019–2025) and Korando (2020–2025) as the top-tier petrol option. No other manufacturers used this engine. It replaced the older 2.0L turbo petrol in the Rexton lineup.",
          },
          {
            question: "Can the 2.5L T-GDi be tuned for more power?",
            answer:
              "Moderate tuning potential. ECU remaps typically yield +20–30 kW safely due to robust internals and twin-scroll turbo. Larger gains require upgraded intercooler and fuel system. Over-tuning risks HPFP and turbo longevity, especially on pre-2023 engines.",
          },
          {
            question: "What's the fuel economy of the 2.5L T-GDi?",
            answer:
              "In a Rexton 2.5 T-GDi, expect ~11.8 L/100km (city), ~8.0 L/100km (highway), or ~29 mpg UK combined. Real-world mixed driving typically yields 27–31 mpg UK, depending on load, terrain, and driving style.",
          },
          {
            question: "Is the 2.5L T-GDi an interference engine?",
            answer:
              "Yes. The 2.5L T-GDi is an interference engine. If the timing chain fails or jumps, piston-to-valve contact will cause severe internal damage. Regular inspection of chain tension and oil quality is essential to prevent catastrophic failure.",
          },
          {
            question: "What oil type does 2.5L T-GDi require?",
            answer:
              "SsangYong specifies SAE 5W-30 oil meeting ACEA C5 or API SP/ILSAC GF-6 standards. Low-SAPS formulation is mandatory for GPF compatibility. Oil must be changed every 10,000 km or 12 months to protect turbo, HPFP, and timing components.",

In standard form it delivers 115 kW (156 PS) and 280 Nm of torque, providing responsive performance across urban and highway conditions.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Korando (C300) and Tivoli (facelifted), the 1.5L T-GDi was engineered for compact SUV efficiency with strong low-end torque.
Emissions compliance is achieved through a gasoline particulate filter (GPF), cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR),
and a three-way catalytic converter, meeting Euro 6d TEMP and later Euro 6d standards depending on model year.`,

            `The SsangYong e-XDi 200 is a 1,998 cc, inline‑four turbo‑diesel engine produced between 2013 and 2020.
It features a DOHC 16‑valve layout, common‑rail direct injection, and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT).
In standard form it delivered 129 kW (175 PS) at 4,000 rpm and 360 Nm of torque at 1,500–2,800 rpm,
providing strong low‑end pull suitable for mid‑size SUV applications.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Rexton W (Y400), Korando C (C200), and Tivoli,
the e-XDi 200 was engineered for a balance of fuel economy, towing capability, and motorway refinement.
Emissions compliance was achieved through exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), a diesel particulate filter (DPF),
and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) with AdBlue injection, enabling Euro 6 compliance across all production years.`,
            `One documented concern is premature wear of the high-pressure fuel pump cam follower, highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB‑FUE‑2016‑03.
This issue stems from marginal lubrication under high thermal load and extended oil change intervals.
From 2017 onward, revised cam follower materials and updated oil specifications were introduced to mitigate the problem.`,

ACEA C3 (or SsangYong Longlife 5W-30) oil is critical due to its low-SAPS formulation protecting aftertreatment components and providing adequate lubrication for the CP4.2 pump.

Post-2017 models feature hardened cam followers per SB‑FUE‑2016‑03. AdBlue consumption averages 1.2 L/1,000 km and must be replenished to maintain emissions compliance.`,

            `The SsangYong e-XDi 220 is a 2,157 cc, inline‑four turbo‑diesel engine produced between 2012 and 2025.
It features a double overhead camshaft (DOHC) layout, 16 valves, and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT).
In standard form it delivers 129 kW (175 PS) and 400 Nm of torque, engineered for strong low-end pulling power and highway efficiency.`,
            `Fitted primarily to the Rexton II (Y400), Korando, and Tivoli SUVs across global markets,
the e-XDi 220 was designed for drivers requiring diesel torque with modern emissions compliance.
Emissions control is achieved via cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC),
and a diesel particulate filter (DPF), enabling Euro 6b compliance from 2015 onward.`,
            `One documented concern is premature wear of the high-pressure fuel pump drive lobe on the camshaft,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB‑ENG‑2018‑07.
This issue stems from marginal surface hardening in early production batches.
From mid‑2018, revised camshafts with improved metallurgy and lubrication channels were introduced to resolve the defect.`,

            `The SsangYong e-XDi 250 is a 2,497 cc, inline‑four turbo‑diesel engine produced from 2012 to present.
It features common-rail direct injection, dual overhead camshafts (DOHC), and a variable geometry turbocharger (VGT).
In standard form it delivers 125 kW (170 PS) and 400 Nm of torque, offering strong low-end pull ideal for towing and off-road use.`,
            `Fitted to models such as the Rexton (Y400), Korando (C200/C300), and Musso (Q200),
the e-XDi 250 was engineered for durability and torque-rich performance in mid-size SUVs and pickups.
Emissions compliance was achieved through cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC),
and a diesel particulate filter (DPF), meeting Euro 5 standards from launch and Euro 6d TEMP from 2018.`,
            `One documented concern is premature wear of the high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP) drive lobe on the camshaft,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB-ENG-2019-04.
This issue stems from marginal surface hardening in early production camshafts under sustained high-load conditions.
From mid-2020, SsangYong introduced a revised camshaft with improved nitriding treatment.`,

Early units (2021–mid-2023) are prone to inverter overheating in sustained high-load scenarios (e.g., mountain driving in >35°C ambient); owners should monitor for power reduction warnings. The single-speed gearbox is maintenance-free but sensitive to incorrect wheel alignment or tire diameter mismatches, which can induce driveline shudder.

            question: "What are the most common problems with e-Motion 200?",
            answer:
              "Key issues include inverter power derating in sub-zero temperatures, 12V battery drain during extended parking, inconsistent regenerative braking at low state-of-charge, and minor coolant loop leaks.

            question: "Can the e-Motion 200 be tuned for more power?",
            answer:
              "No. SsangYong does not support aftermarket tuning of the e-Motion 200. The motor, inverter, and battery management system are tightly integrated, and software modifications void warranty and may compromise safety certifications. Power output is fixed by factory calibration.",

          {
            question: "Does the e-Motion 200 require oil changes?",
            answer:
              "No. As a fully electric drive unit, it uses no engine oil. However, the single-speed gearbox contains a sealed lubricant (SsangYong EV Gear Oil) designed to last the vehicle’s lifetime under normal conditions—no user service is required.",

            `The SsangYong e-Motion AWD is a dual-motor all‑wheel‑drive electric powertrain introduced in 2023.
It features two permanent‑magnet synchronous motors (PMSM)—one on each axle—delivering combined output of 150 kW (204 PS) and 350 Nm of torque.
The system is paired with a single‑speed reduction gearbox per motor and a 61.5 kWh lithium‑nickel‑manganese‑cobalt oxide (NMC) traction battery.`,
            `Fitted exclusively to the Korando e-Motion SUV, the e-Motion AWD was engineered for urban and light off‑road use,
balancing efficiency with responsive all‑weather traction. Emissions compliance is inherent to its zero‑tailpipe design,
and the vehicle meets EU Whole Vehicle Type Approval (WVTA) under Regulation (EU) 2018/858 with CO₂ certification at 0 g/km.`,
            `One documented concern is thermal derating of the rear motor inverter under sustained high‑load hill climbs,
highlighted in SsangYong Service Bulletin SB‑EV‑2024‑02.
This issue stems from marginal airflow through the rear inverter heat sink during low‑speed, high‑torque scenarios.
From Q3 2024 onward, revised inverter cooling ducting and updated thermal management software were introduced to mitigate the problem.`,
